# Be aware of the reliability trap

## Question
How can I train people for secondary incident processes?

## Heuristic
Be aware of the reliability trap.

## Examples
- Outages that last because people are not used to secondary incident processes
- Use Wardley Maps, Cynefin and Chaos Engineering to create meaningful drills to discover threads to the sociotechnical system
- Training people in the processes
- Evaluate if processes are valid
