# When it gets too crowded in your head, write it down

## Question
How can I settle my own thoughts?

## Heuristic
When it gets too crowded in your head, write it down.

## Examples
- I'm in a context switching situation
- Some ideas got together, and looks like they work
- I want to share ideas after a presentation (public/private)
