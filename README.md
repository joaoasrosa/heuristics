# Heuristics pet project

I started to collect heuristics after [Rebecca Wirfs-Brock](https://twitter.com/rebeccawb) workshop at DDD Europe 2020. And because I believe that the knowledge belongs to the community, I created this project. Also, most of the heuristics are not mine, and I capture it along the years. 

It can help to design your software, your organisation and everything is between.

## What is the technique?

I use Rebecca's QHE (Question, Heuristic, Example) technique. You can start with any of the components, the important is to record the information.

For this project, I also added the event where the heuristic was capture, the date (not accurate) and the person that inspired me. I believe that it is essential to give the context about the heuristic.

## I need your help...

You can help in several ways:
- Give feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/joaoasrosa/heuristics/issues) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joaoasrosa)
- Spread the word
- Correct the data of the heuristic
- Add your heuristic, I would love to see what the community is doing
